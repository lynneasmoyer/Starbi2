        <p>We are women in tech. </p>
        <p>We created Starbi while learning Unityâ€”and in less than a week. </p>
        <p>Our aim was to create a fun, interactive world with a first-person female character. We found a basic world template in the Unity Asset Store, along with a base character, but we had to handle the rest: getting the character to move and interact with objects, adding a sidekick (a free cat asset hand-modified to look like a little fox), moving donuts, running vehicles, audio clips, a self-esteem bar, an end-goal, and more.</p>
        <p>We're proud of what we accomplished and hope you enjoy playing!</p>
